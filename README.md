This was the final project for the Codecademy certificate "Programming with Python" that I finished in January of 2019.
I was happy to have received an "A" on the assignment, even though it was challenging (being my first real exposure to the language)
Please feel free to have a look inside the root folder.
It was mostly a test of our learned skills in OOP (object-oriented programming).
