This was the final project for the Codecademy certificate "Programming with Python" that I finished in January of 2019.
It was mostly a test of our learned skills in OOP (object-oriented programming).
I was very happy to have received a solid grade on the assignment, even though it was quite challenging for me at the time (in hindsight, that was mostly because it was my first real exposure to the language, and even though Python is not known to have a steep learning curve for beginners, it does take time to master the problem-solving aspect of computer programming).
That aside, please feel free to have a look inside the root folder if you are interested!  
Also, here is a snippet of some of my Python OOP:
